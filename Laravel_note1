#Run the app on local development server:

------------------------------
Ref:  https://dev.to/kingsconsult/how-to-create-a-secure-crud-restful-api-in-laravel-8-and-7-using-laravel-passport-31fh
#cmd
composer require laravel/passport

#specify the default string length
go,
app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php
//then update the boot function

Schema::defaultstringLength(191);

//add the below statement to top of the class
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;

//then, run the migration cmd
php artisan migrate

#STEP :  Create the encryption keys
//We need to create the encryption keys that are needed to generate our secure access tokens.
//This command will also create "personal access" and "password grant" clients which will be used to generate access tokens.

php artisan passport:install


#STEP : Add the HasApiTokens trait to our user model
//Go to App\Models\User.php and tell the User class to :

use Laravel\Passport\HasApiTokens;

//default (need no to do if it added automatically) >>  use Laravel\Sanctum\HasApiTokens;

#STEP:
//Call the passport routes in AuthServiceProvider
//Go to App/Providers/AuthServiceProvider.php and add  to boot method
Passport::routes();

//To the boot method, also add the path before the class at the top

    use Laravel\Passport\Passport;
//Uncomment the policy in the protected method of $policies

#STEP:
Set the driver
//This will be the final step in the setting up and configuration of Laravel\Passport, we going to change our api driver from the default token to passport.
Go to config\auth.php and locate the guards array. In the api key, change the driver from token to passport 

//**
    'guards' => [
        'web' => [
            'driver' => 'session',
            'provider' => 'users',
        ],

        'api' => [
            'driver' => 'passport',
            'provider' => 'users',
            'hash'=>false,
        ],
    ],

//**

#Creating migration files for the project  (our end)
